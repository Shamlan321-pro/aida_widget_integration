# Packaging Issue Fix

## Problem Description

The AIDA Widget Integration app was experiencing installation failures with the following error:

```
flit_core.common.NoVersionError: Cannot package module without a version string. 
Please define a `__version__ = "x.y.z"` in your module.
```

This error occurred during the `bench get-app` installation process when pip tried to build the package using flit.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:

1. **Build System Configuration**: The original `pyproject.toml` used `flit_core` as the build backend
2. **Module Structure**: Flit had difficulty locating the version string in the nested module structure
3. **Dynamic Version**: The configuration used `dynamic = ["version"]` which required flit to find the version at build time

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Changed Build System

**Before:**
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["flit_core >=3.4,<4"]
build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"
```

**After:**
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=45", "wheel", "setuptools_scm[toml]>=6.2"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

### 2. Fixed Version Configuration

**Before:**
```toml
dynamic = ["version"]
```

**After:**
```toml
version = "0.0.1"
```

### 3. Added Fallback Files

Created additional packaging files for better compatibility:

- **`setup.py`**: Traditional setuptools configuration as fallback
- **`MANIFEST.in`**: Ensures all necessary files are included in the distribution

### 4. Updated Documentation

Enhanced installation guides with:
- Multiple installation methods
- Troubleshooting for packaging errors
- Manual installation instructions

## Files Modified

1. **`pyproject.toml`**:
   - Changed build system from flit to setuptools
   - Fixed version configuration
   - Removed dynamic version lookup

2. **`setup.py`** (new):
   - Added traditional setuptools configuration
   - Provides fallback installation method
   - Includes proper package discovery

3. **`MANIFEST.in`** (new):
   - Ensures all Frappe app files are included
   - Covers templates, static files, and configuration

4. **`INSTALLATION.md`**:
   - Added multiple installation methods
   - Included manual installation instructions
   - Added troubleshooting steps

5. **`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`**:
   - Added packaging error section
   - Provided specific solutions for build failures
   - Included alternative installation methods

## Installation Methods Available

### Method 1: Standard Installation
```bash
bench get-app aida_widget_integration https://github.com/Shamlan321-pro/aida_widget_integration
bench --site [site-name] install-app aida_widget_integration
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation (Recommended for packaging issues)
```bash
cd /path/to/your/bench/apps
git clone https://github.com/Shamlan321-pro/aida_widget_integration
cd /path/to/your/bench
./env/bin/pip install -e apps/aida_widget_integration
bench --site [site-name] install-app aida_widget_integration
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Improved Compatibility**: Works with more Python environments and build tools
2. **Multiple Installation Paths**: Provides fallback options if one method fails
3. **Better Error Handling**: Clear documentation for troubleshooting
4. **Future-Proof**: Uses stable, well-supported build systems
5. **Frappe Compliance**: Ensures all Frappe app files are properly packaged

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Test Standard Installation**:
   ```bash
   bench get-app aida_widget_integration https://github.com/Shamlan321-pro/aida_widget_integration
   ```

2. **Test Manual Installation**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shamlan321-pro/aida_widget_integration
   pip install -e aida_widget_integration
   ```

3. **Verify Package Contents**:
   ```bash
   python -c "import aida_widget_integration; print(aida_widget_integration.__version__)"
   ```

## Future Considerations

- Monitor for any new packaging issues with different Python versions
- Consider using `setuptools_scm` for automatic version management from git tags
- Keep both `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py` for maximum compatibility
- Regular testing across different Mocxha/Frappe versions
